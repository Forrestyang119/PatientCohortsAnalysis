# GreedySearch
A program to learn weights of each attribute from several given groups of patients.
## Weights Learning
1. Get a csv file which contains several groups, each group has three patients, and each patient has several attributes.
2. We should know which two patients are similar in each group(labeled by a doctor), and enter them to the code.
3. Run the "WeightsLearning.py", it will write the best accuracy into "output.csv"(it can reach 61%) and the weight change into "weight.csv".
